CRACKING THE CODING INTERVIEW BOOK
4th edition
Book summary

/*
+-----------------------------------------+

After gone through this book I have summarized the below ideas:

1- Most of the interviewing companies apply the below strategy:
        A- Phone interview
        B- Call you to onsite interviews which are normally around 3 to 6 ones.
   If after one week of no word from HR, send them a friendly email asking for a status update 

2- Before the interview: 
        A- Resume: Resume Screeners Look for your smartness and ability to code so therefore you should list in your resume your previous projects, Programming Languages and Software
        B- Technical Preparation: Try to solve the problem on your own, write the algorithm code on paper, and do a pre-interview
        C- Important basics: Data Structures, Algorithms, and Concepts
        D- Prepare for technical questions by: Prepare the Core Testing Problems, Practice the Coding, and Practice Testing

3- At the interview:
        A- Be Specific, use limit details, structure your response
        B- Interviewers sometimes are huge fans of the company therefore you should show this same passion
        C- Sometimes the phone interview is conducted by someone with influence
        D- Technical Questions at the interviews are hard most of the times so ask for clarification, design algorithm, write a pseudo-code, write the actual code, and finally test to find and fix mistakes
        E- The effective 5 Algorithm Approaches: 
                1- EXAMPLIFY
                2- PATTERN MATCHING
                3- SIMPLIFY & GENERALIZE
                4- BASE CASE AND BUILD
                5- DATA STRUCTURE BRAINSTORM
        

4- Top mistakes candidates make:
        A- Get used to pen and paper not complier only
        B- Do not spend 100% of your time on the technical questions , Behavioural Questions are important too
        C- Do Mock Interview but with real tech people not alone only
        D- Real preparation is about learning how to approach new problems not memorize them
        E- Avoid talking too much or too little
        F- Take your time and do not rush
        G- When write a code, test it
        H- Avoid Sloppy Coding
        I- Struggling on a question does not mean you’re doing bad. So don’t give up

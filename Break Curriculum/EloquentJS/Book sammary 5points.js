Book summary

/*
+-----------------------------------------+

After gone through this resource full and valuable book I have learnt the below new ideas:

1-	Program is a:
    Punch of statements, which may contain more statements in it, and expressions, which may contain smaller expressions in it. 
    When putting statement after one another gives the shape of the program that is executed from top to bottom.

2-	Functions can be divided into three types:
    a-	Side effects Functions.
    b-	Return with their value Function. ‘and it can be side effect type too’.
    c-	Pure functions “I.e. function that only has no side effects and doesn’t rely on side effects functions from other code.

3-	Bugs and Error:
    ‘Mistakes and bad input are facts of life’
    The most important part of overcoming Bugs and Errors is by 
    1-	Finding Bugs and Error.
    2-	Diagnosing.
    3-	Testing.
    4-	Fixing.
    This can be done: manually, creating a special program for it, and/or using a built-in error checker such as "use strict".


4-	Modules:
    Is a piece of program that provides structure to a well-designed program. Module separates code into pieces with interfaces and dependencies, and allow these pieces to run on their own
    Working in this way requires infrastructure, and this infrastructure is provided by NPM.
    NPM is divided in two sections
    A-	online service “where the packages are”
    B-	program (bundled with Node.js) that helps you install and manage them

5-Node.js
    Small yet very powerfull system, that lets us run JavaScript in a non-browser context. The purpose of it is to make asynchronous programming easy and convenient.
    Node comes with built-in modules, including:
    a-	 FS module for file system
    b-	http module HTTP servers and HTTP requests.
